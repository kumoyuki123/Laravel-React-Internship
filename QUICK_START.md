# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Project Overview
Your Laravel React Authentication & Management System is now fully refactored with:
- ✅ **Role-based authentication** (Superuser, HR Admin, Supervisor, Leader)
- ✅ **Automatic employee creation** when student IQ ≥ 60
- ✅ **Route protection** and logout URL prevention
- ✅ **Complete CRUD operations** for Schools, Students, Employees, Attendance
- ✅ **Fixed "Route [login] not defined" error**

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Backend Setup
```bash
cd laravel-api-auth

# Copy environment file
copy .env.example .env

# Install dependencies and setup
composer install
php artisan key:generate

# Update .env with your database credentials:
# DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
# DB_USERNAME=your_username  
# DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Run migrations and seeders
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Start Laravel server
php artisan serve
```

### Step 2: Frontend Setup
```bash
cd rect-auth

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start React development server
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the System
Open browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`

**Login with default accounts:**
- **Superuser**: `superadmin@example.com` / `password`
- **HR Admin**: `hradmin@example.com` / `password`
- **Supervisor**: `supervisor@example.com` / `password`
- **Leader**: `leader@example.com` / `password`

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
| Feature | Superuser | HR Admin | Supervisor | Leader |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|--------|
| User Management | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| School CRUD | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | View Only |
| Student CRUD | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Employee CRUD | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | View Only |
| Attendance CRUD | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### 2. Business Logic
- **Automatic Employee Creation**: Students with IQ ≥ 60 automatically become employees
- **Example Data**: MIIT school with Phyu Phyu student (IQ: 69) → Auto-employee
- **Attendance Tracking**: Daily records with status (present/absent/late) and check-in times

### 3. Security Features
- **JWT Authentication** with Laravel Sanctum
- **Route Protection** based on user roles
- **Logout URL Prevention** (direct /logout access blocked)
- **CORS Configuration** for React frontend
- **Middleware Protection** on all API endpoints

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Option 1: Use the Test Script
```bash
cd laravel-api-auth
php test_api.php
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing
1. **Login Test**: Try logging in with different role accounts
2. **Permission Test**: Access restricted features with different roles
3. **Student-Employee Test**: Create a student with IQ ≥ 60, verify employee creation
4. **Logout Test**: Try accessing `/logout` directly (should redirect)

## 📊 Sample Data Created

### Schools
- **MIIT** (Teacher: Daw YiYi, Email: yiyi@gmail.com)
- **University of Computer Studies**
- **Yangon Technological University**

### Students
- **Phyu Phyu** (Roll: 9, IQ: 69, Major: EC, Year: First Year) → Auto-Employee
- Additional test students with varying IQ scores

### Attendance Records
- 30 days of sample attendance data for all students
- Mix of present/absent/late statuses with realistic check-in times

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Route [login] not defined"** ✅ FIXED
   - Added named login route in `routes/web.php`
   - Updated authentication configuration

2. **CORS Errors** ✅ FIXED
   - Added `config/cors.php` with React frontend URLs
   - Configured Sanctum stateful domains

3. **Token Issues** ✅ FIXED
   - Updated API interceptors in React
   - Proper token handling and refresh

4. **Database Connection**
   - Verify credentials in `.env`
   - Ensure MySQL server is running
   - Create database if it doesn't exist
